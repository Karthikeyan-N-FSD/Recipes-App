# Recipe Management API

This project is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose for managing recipes. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to store and retrieve recipe information in a MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
* **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* **dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
* **cors:** A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

## Functionalities

The API provides the following functionalities:

* **Create Recipe (POST /recipe):** Adds a new recipe to the database.
* **Get All Recipes (GET /recipes):** Retrieves a list of all recipes.
* **Get Recipe by ID (GET /recipe/:id):** Retrieves a specific recipe based on its unique ID.
* **Update Recipe (PUT /recipe/:id):** Updates an existing recipe identified by its ID.
* **Delete Recipe (DELETE /recipe/:id):** Deletes a recipe from the database based on its ID.

## Base URL

The base URL for this API is: `https://kaz-recipes-app.onrender.com`
